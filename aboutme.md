## Emerging Technology Scholarship Submission
By: **Matthew Butler**

### About Me
Hi! My name is Matthew Butler and I am a 19 year old programmer/computer scientist. This is my submission for the 2025 Emerging Technology Scholarship at Full Sail University. My planned start date is Augest 2025.

##### -*A bit about myself*-
I have been in love with programming since I was eight years old. I started playing video games at the age of 3, around eight years old is when i started making little games in my free time using unity game engine. My love of technology grew from there. This led me to pursue a associates degree in computer science my freshman year of highschool. I graduated high school with 46 college credits and then graduated from Navarro College with my associates degree one semister later. I'm looking to expand my eduacation at Full Sail. I currently know a varity of languages all at diffrent experiance levels
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* C#
* Python
* C++

##### -*My Project*-
I have always been particularly intrested in graph theory in Math, so I knew I wanted to do something related to that. I was browsing wikipidiea looking around at diffrent computer science problems and found my way onto *vertex coloring*. The problem peaked my intrest so I decided I would make a vertex coloring solver. I have built it in c++ using SFML as my graphics library. I have worked with c++ in the past but this is my first project using SFML.
